# STIM

I did these set of python modules during my PhD at IRCAM to handle the creation and transformation of audio and video experimental stimuli.

These python modules allow to easilly handle indexing of audio/video databases, transform audio and video in different ways but also extract different audio features.

I'll do a set of tutorials soon to show how these modules work.

Some interesting modules:

## audio_analysis ##
Extracting features from audio

## super_vp_commands ##
A set of wraper functions around IRCAM super-vp library (needs audiosculpt http://forumnet.ircam.fr/product/audiosculpt-en/)

## video_processing ##
A set of functions to handle video indexing, audio replacement in video, resolution changes, and more...
