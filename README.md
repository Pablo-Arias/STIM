# STIM

I did these set of python modules during my PhD at IRCAM to handle the creation and transformation of audio and video experimental stimuli.

These python modules allow to easilly handle indexing of audio/video databases, transform audio and video in different ways but also extract different audio features.

I'll do a set of tutorials soon to show how these modules work.

Some interesting modules:

## audio_analysis ##
Extracting features from audio

## super_vp_commands ##
A set of wraper functions around IRCAM super-vp library (needs audiosculpt http://forumnet.ircam.fr/product/audiosculpt-en/)

## video_processing ##
A set of functions to handle video indexing, audio replacement in video, resolution changes, and more...

## Instalation and dependencies ##
These python modules depend on several externals for them to work properly. If you want to use the super_vp_commands or parse sdif files you should isntall all of the above packages.


* Download
Download the files of STIM and put them somewhere safe in your computer. If you are using anaconda, you add this path to a so these scripts 


* Install Homebrew, info [here](https://brew.sh/)

* Install libsnd: 
```
brew install libsndfile
```

* Install sckits.audiolab toolbox :
```
pip install scikits.audiolab"
```

* Install Audiosculpt
These scripts use Audiosculpt to generate and parse audio analysis. 
Thus for them to work properly, make sure you installed Audiosculpt from the [ircam forum](http://forumnet.ircam.fr/)
Once you installed Audiosculpt, you should change your update the "Audiosculpt version" in the script super_vp_path inside of the STIM folder so that the python module can call Audiosculpt.


* Install EASDIF
Now on to the fun part,
To parse the files generated by audiosculpt automatically with python, (.sdif files) you will need the EASDIF library, which can be installed with the following commands:

```
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@sdif.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/sdif login 
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@sdif.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/sdif co -P EASDIF_SDIF
cd EASDIF_SDIF
mkdir -p build_EASDIF_x86_64
cd build_EASDIF_x86_64
rm -f CMakeCache.txt
cmake -DEASDIF_DO_PYTHON:bool=on -DPYTHON:STRING=python ..
make install_python_easdif_module_globally
```

or if you have no right to write into your python installation

```
make install_python_easdif_module_locally
```


## Instalation and dependencies ##
Now you can check the example modules to learn how to use these scripts.

Just open the .ipybn files inside the folder notebook_examples of the STIM
